        <p>The amber droplet hung from the branch, 
            reaching fullness and ready to drop. 
            It waited. While many of the other droplets
            were satisfied to form as big as they could
            and release, this droplet had other plans.
            It wanted to be part of history.
            It wanted to be remembered long after all the
            other droplets had dissolved into history. 
            So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by 
            to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually
            be discovered hundreds of years in the future.
